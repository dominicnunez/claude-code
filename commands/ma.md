# Multi-Agent Architecture Design

I'll orchestrate multiple GAD agents to design architecture in parallel, creating comprehensive documentation.

## Architecture Task
$ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Parallel Design**: 3 GAD agents work simultaneously with different focuses:
   - Agent 1: Simplicity & Maintainability
   - Agent 2: Scalability & Performance
   - Agent 3: Flexibility & Extensibility

2. **Synthesis**: Best ideas from all approaches are combined
3. **Documentation**: Complete architecture specs and implementation guidance

This creates robust, well-considered system architectures through diverse parallel exploration.

```bash
python ~/.claude/hooks/multi_agent/multi_agent_design.py "$ARGUMENTS"
