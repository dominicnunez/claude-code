# Comprehensive Iterative Architecture Design System

I'll run an iterative multi-agent design process that continues refining until we achieve comprehensive architectural documentation for your Go application.

## Application Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Process Overview

This will:
1. **Extract all features** from your requirements
2. **Run iterative design cycles** (up to 5 iterations):
   - 3 GAD agents design in parallel (Simplicity, Scalability, Flexibility focuses)
   - Review agent evaluates completeness (must achieve â‰¥90% coverage)
   - If gaps exist, agents receive feedback and refine in next iteration
3. **Build comprehensive documentation** including:
   - System overview and architecture
   - Detailed component designs
   - API specifications
   - Data models
   - Security architecture
   - Implementation roadmap

Let me launch the iterative design system to create production-ready architecture documentation for your application.

```bash
python ~/.claude/hooks/multi_agent/iterative_design_system.py "$ARGUMENTS"
