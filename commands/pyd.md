# Python Implementation Specialist

I'll help you implement Python code following best practices and Python idioms.

## Task
$ARGUMENTS

## Approach

I'll provide Python implementation focusing on:
- Clean, readable, Pythonic code
- Full type hints (Python 3.10+ syntax)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper testing with pytest
- Performance optimization where needed
- Following PEP 8 and Python best practices

The implementation will be provided in the terminal unless you specifically request file creation.

```bash
# Delegating to pyd agent for Python implementation
echo "Analyzing Python implementation requirements..."
```
