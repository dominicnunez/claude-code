so for design.py i want to use it like so: "/design pomodoro timer" > 5 gad agents create their pomodoro timer, 1 gad picks the best of the 5 and puts it in a appendix.md file the locaton of which can be found in (back or front)/.docs/plan directory. I wonder if this procress could be language agnostic some how as well; for example if i had a python archictect/designer would be able to use the same "/design pomodoro timer" so maybe i need to specific the specific language architect like "/design go pomodoro timer" or "/design gad pomodoro timer"?
