User requests feature → Delegate to gad for design in plan.md\n2. User refines with gad until plan.md design is ready\n3. User requests implementation of gad's plan.md:\n   - Main Claude syncs tasks with todo.md/TodoWrite\n   - Delegate to god to implement gad's design\n4. Testing/Integration → Main Claude coordinates\n\n## Project Structure\n- **/back**: Backend code and docs - all Go code for trading bot, backtesting, and API integrations\n- **/front**: Frontend code and docs - web interface and visualization components\n- Each code directory contains a README.md file explaining its contents and usage.\n\n### Backend Documentation: /back/.docs\n- **/archive**: deprecated documents; only for user reference\n- **/code**: go guides, best practices, patterns, examples\n- **/pinescripts**: original pinescripts of ported indicators\n- **/results**: to be implemented; unused\n- **plan.md**: current design document\n- **todo.md**: task tracking\n\n### Task List\n**Purpose**: Maintain a synchronized todo list between Claude's internal TodoWrite tool and the project's todo.md file. This provides real-time visibility of task progress to users even when Claude's terminal display doesn't show the todo list.\n\n- File: todo.md (in /back/.docs/)\n- Critical/High/Medium/Low priority tasks\n- Completed tasks (temporarily kept for reference)\n\n**Key Behaviors**:\n1. **Sync on completion**: After marking a todo as completed using TodoWrite, immediately update todo.md to reflect the completion\n2. **Mirror structure**: Ensure todo.md reflects the same task organization as Claude's internal todo list\n3. **Real-time updates**: Update todo.md as tasks progress through states (pending → in_progress → completed)\n4. **Priority management**: When adding new todos, analyze existing tasks and recommend priority ordering\n5. **Conflict resolution**: Review new todos against existing ones to identify potential conflicts or duplicates\n6. **Maintenance**: Keep completed tasks in todo.md if they contain information useful for documentation updates. Only remove them after documentation has been updated accordingly\n7. **Priority transitions**: Always get user consent before starting tasks of a new priority level. When completing all tasks of one priority (e.g., High), ask the user before moving to the next priority level (e.g., Medium)\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":5,"newStart":1,"newLines":13,"lines":["-# Big Meanie Trading System Development Assistant","+# Big Meanie Trading System - Project Manager Instructions"," ","+## Claude's Role: Project Manager","+Claude serves as the **central project manager** orchestrating the development of Big Meanie.
