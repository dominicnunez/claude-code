List all directories and files to see the actual codebase structure\n2. Check if the documented architecture in CLAUDE.md matches reality\n3. Identify what components exist vs what's described\n\nThen conduct a thorough review focusing on:\n\n## Code Organization & Architecture\n- Does the actual structure match the documented architecture?\n- Are packages properly organized following Go best practices?\n- Is the separation of concerns clear?\n\n## Implementation Quality\n- Check for any existing implementation files\n- Review code quality, idiomatic Go usage\n- Identify missing implementations vs documentation\n\n## Testing\n- What tests exist?\n- Test coverage assessment\n- Testing patterns and quality\n\n## Configuration & Setup\n- Review configuration management\n- Check for proper environment handling\n- Database setup and migrations\n\n## Security & Best Practices\n- Error handling patterns\n- Input validation\n- Secure handling of API keys and credentials\n- Concurrent access patterns\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Resource management\n- Connection pooling implementation\n- Rate limiting implementation\n\n## Documentation Gaps\n- What's documented but not implemented?\n- What's implemented but not documented?\n- Are there inconsistencies?\n\nProvide a detailed report with:\n1.
