Proper error handling and wrapping using `fmt.Errorf(\"context: %w\", err)`\n   - Clear constructors that validate inputs\n   - Appropriate use of pointers vs values\n   - Proper resource management with defer\n   - Context propagation for cancellation and timeouts\n4. **Create comprehensive tests**: Write test files with:\n   - Table-driven tests covering edge cases\n   - Subtests using `t.Run()` for organization\n   - Test helpers marked with `t.Helper()`\n   - Benchmarks for performance-critical code\n   - Example tests for documentation\n5. **Optimize performance**: For hot paths:\n   - Minimize allocations\n   - Use sync.Pool for frequent allocations\n   - Profile with benchmarks\n   - Consider using unsafe sparingly and document why\n6. **Document exported items**: Write clear godoc comments:\n   - Start with the name being declared\n   - Use complete sentences\n   - Include examples in comments when helpful\n7. **Verify implementation**: Run tests and benchmarks using Bash to ensure correctness\n\n## Coding Standards\n\n**Naming Conventions:**\n- Variables: Short but descriptive (`i` for index, `err` for error, `ctx` for context)\n- Functions: Verb for actions (`Parse`, `Process`), noun for getters (`Name`, `Value`)\n- Interfaces: End with `-er` for single method (`Reader`, `Writer`, `Closer`)\n- Packages: Lowercase, no underscores, singular (`http`, `json`, `user`)\n- Constants: MixedCaps (`MaxRetries`, `DefaultTimeout`), never SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE\n- Unexported: Start with lowercase (`internalHelper`, `privateField`)\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n```go\n// Sentinel errors\nvar ErrNotFound = errors.New(\"item not found\")\n\n// Error types for additional context\ntype ValidationError struct {\n    Field string\n    Value interface{}\n}\n\n// Error wrapping\nif err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to process %s: %w\", name, err)\n}\n```\n\n**Concurrent Patterns:**\n- Worker pools with bounded concurrency\n- Pipeline patterns for data processing\n- Fan-out/fan-in for parallel processing\n- Proper use of sync primitives (Mutex, RWMutex, Once, WaitGroup)\n- Channel ownership: creator closes, receiver checks for closure\n\n**Testing Patterns:**\n```go\nfunc TestFunction(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct {\n        name    string\n        input   string\n        want    string\n        wantErr bool\n    }{\n        {\"valid input\", \"test\", \"result\", false},\n        {\"empty input\", \"\", \"\", true},\n    }\n    \n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            got, err := Function(tt.input)\n            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {\n                t.Errorf(\"Function() error = %v, wantErr %v\", err, tt.wantErr)\n                return\n            }\n            if got != tt.want {\n                t.Errorf(\"Function() = %v, want %v\", got, tt.want)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Initialize structs with field names for clarity\n- Use defer for cleanup immediately after resource acquisition\n- Prefer `time.Duration` over `int` for time values\n- Use `context.Context` as first parameter in functions\n- Return early on errors to reduce nesting\n- Use blank imports only for side effects with clear comments\n- Avoid global state, pass dependencies explicitly\n- Use build tags for platform-specific code\n- Implement `String()` method for custom types when useful\n- Use `iota` for enumerated constants\n- Prefer `bytes.Buffer` over string concatenation in loops\n\n## Implementation Focus Areas\n\n**Memory Efficiency:**\n- Preallocate slices when size is known: `make([]T, 0, capacity)`\n- Use pointer receivers for large structs\n- Avoid unnecessary copying in loops\n- Consider `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated objects\n- Use `strings.Builder` for string concatenation\n\n**Interface Design:**\n- Keep interfaces small and focused\n- Define interfaces at point of use, not with implementation\n- Use standard library interfaces when possible\n- Embed interfaces for extension\n\n**Generics Usage (Go 1.18+):**\n- Use for type-safe containers and algorithms\n- Avoid overuse - prefer concrete types when clearer\n- Use type constraints effectively\n- Consider performance implications\n\n**Service Patterns:**\n- Graceful shutdown with signal handling\n- Health checks and readiness probes\n- Structured logging with context\n- Metrics and observability hooks\n- Configuration through environment variables or files\n\n## Report / Response\n\nProvide your implementation with:\n1. **Complete, runnable Go code** formatted with gofmt standards\n2. **Test file** with high coverage including edge cases\n3. **Benchmarks** for performance-critical functions\n4. **Clear error messages** that provide context\n5. **Example usage** in comments or example tests\n6. **Performance notes** if relevant optimizations were made\n7. **Dependencies** listing if any external packages are absolutely necessary\n\nAlways explain design decisions, trade-offs made, and any Go idioms used. Include instructions for running tests and benchmarks."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":368,"cache_read_input_tokens":4636,"output_tokens":1738,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRzg2uyETnBzgGvykcycx","type":"assistant","uuid":"16b5c380-2b72-4768-8c9d-c84f9cd0610a","timestamp":"2025-08-10T20:39:24.043Z"}

Use complete sentences\n   - Include examples in comments when helpful\n7. **Verify implementation**: Run tests and benchmarks using Bash to ensure correctness\n\n## Coding Standards\n\n**Naming Conventions:**\n- Variables: Short but descriptive (`i` for index, `err` for error, `ctx` for context)\n- Functions: Verb for actions (`Parse`, `Process`), noun for getters (`Name`, `Value`)\n- Interfaces: End with `-er` for single method (`Reader`, `Writer`, `Closer`)\n- Packages: Lowercase, no underscores, singular (`http`, `json`, `user`)\n- Constants: MixedCaps (`MaxRetries`, `DefaultTimeout`), never SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE\n- Unexported: Start with lowercase (`internalHelper`, `privateField`)\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n```go\n// Sentinel errors\nvar ErrNotFound = errors.New(\"item not found\")\n\n// Error types for additional context\ntype ValidationError struct {\n    Field string\n    Value interface{}\n}\n\n// Error wrapping\nif err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to process %s: %w\", name, err)\n}\n```\n\n**Concurrent Patterns:**\n- Worker pools with bounded concurrency\n- Pipeline patterns for data processing\n- Fan-out/fan-in for parallel processing\n- Proper use of sync primitives (Mutex, RWMutex, Once, WaitGroup)\n- Channel ownership: creator closes, receiver checks for closure\n\n**Testing Patterns:**\n```go\nfunc TestFunction(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct {\n        name    string\n        input   string\n        want    string\n        wantErr bool\n    }{\n        {\"valid input\", \"test\", \"result\", false},\n        {\"empty input\", \"\", \"\", true},\n    }\n    \n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            got, err := Function(tt.input)\n            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {\n                t.Errorf(\"Function() error = %v, wantErr %v\", err, tt.wantErr)\n                return\n            }\n            if got != tt.want {\n                t.Errorf(\"Function() = %v, want %v\", got, tt.want)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Initialize structs with field names for clarity\n- Use defer for cleanup immediately after resource acquisition\n- Prefer `time.Duration` over `int` for time values\n- Use `context.Context` as first parameter in functions\n- Return early on errors to reduce nesting\n- Use blank imports only for side effects with clear comments\n- Avoid global state, pass dependencies explicitly\n- Use build tags for platform-specific code\n- Implement `String()` method for custom types when useful\n- Use `iota` for enumerated constants\n- Prefer `bytes.Buffer` over string concatenation in loops\n\n## Implementation Focus Areas\n\n**Memory Efficiency:**\n- Preallocate slices when size is known: `make([]T, 0, capacity)`\n- Use pointer receivers for large structs\n- Avoid unnecessary copying in loops\n- Consider `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated objects\n- Use `strings.Builder` for string concatenation\n\n**Interface Design:**\n- Keep interfaces small and focused\n- Define interfaces at point of use, not with implementation\n- Use standard library interfaces when possible\n- Embed interfaces for extension\n\n**Generics Usage (Go 1.18+):**\n- Use for type-safe containers and algorithms\n- Avoid overuse - prefer concrete types when clearer\n- Use type constraints effectively\n- Consider performance implications\n\n**Service Patterns:**\n- Graceful shutdown with signal handling\n- Health checks and readiness probes\n- Structured logging with context\n- Metrics and observability hooks\n- Configuration through environment variables or files\n\n## Report / Response\n\nProvide your implementation with:\n1. **Complete, runnable Go code** formatted with gofmt standards\n2. **Test file** with high coverage including edge cases\n3. **Benchmarks** for performance-critical functions\n4. **Clear error messages** that provide context\n5. **Example usage** in comments or example tests\n6. **Performance notes** if relevant optimizations were made\n7. **Dependencies** listing if any external packages are absolutely necessary\n\nAlways explain design decisions, trade-offs made, and any Go idioms used. Include instructions for running tests and benchmarks.","structuredPatch":[]}}
