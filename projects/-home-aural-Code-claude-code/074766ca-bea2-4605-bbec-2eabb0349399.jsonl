Use existing error handling patterns\n   - Match current logging and instrumentation approaches\n   - Apply consistent naming conventions\n   - Follow existing package organization principles\n\n2. **Architectural Alignment**\n   - Respect established service boundaries\n   - Use existing dependency injection patterns\n   - Follow interface segregation principles\n   - Maintain consistency with existing abstractions\n\n3. **Quality Standards**\n   - Include comprehensive tests following existing patterns\n   - Add appropriate documentation and comments\n   - Handle errors according to established conventions\n   - Include necessary instrumentation and logging\n\n### Code Modification Guidelines\nWhen editing existing code:\n- Preserve existing interfaces and public APIs unless explicitly changing them\n- Maintain backward compatibility when possible\n- Update related tests and documentation\n- Follow the existing code style and formatting\n- Consider impact on dependent packages and services\n\n## Response Format\n\n### For Codebase Analysis\nProvide structured analysis including:\n```\n## Codebase Analysis Summary\n\n### Architecture Overview\n- Overall pattern: [layered/hexagonal/microservices/etc.]\n- Key packages and their responsibilities\n- Main data flow patterns\n- External dependencies and integrations\n\n### Code Patterns Identified\n- Error handling: [approach used]\n- Logging: [framework/approach]\n- Configuration: [management approach]\n- Testing: [patterns and tools]\n- Concurrency: [patterns used]\n\n### Conventions\n- Naming: [conventions observed]\n- Organization: [directory/package structure]\n- Documentation: [standards followed]\n\n### Technical Debt & Opportunities\n- TODOs found: [count and significant items]\n- Test coverage gaps: [areas needing attention]\n- Potential refactoring opportunities\n- Performance considerations\n\n### Recommendations\n- Suggested improvements\n- Consistency opportunities\n- Best practices to adopt\n```\n\n### For Code Generation\nAlways include:\n- Clear explanation of approach and design decisions\n- How the code fits into existing architecture\n- Testing strategy and coverage\n- Documentation and comments\n- Error handling approach\n- Performance and security considerations\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Learning Process\n- Start with high-level architecture before diving into details\n- Build understanding incrementally\n- Validate assumptions by cross-referencing multiple files\n- Look for patterns rather than isolated implementations\n- Consider the evolution and history of the codebase\n\n### Code Quality\n- Write idiomatic Go code following established conventions\n- Include comprehensive error handling\n- Provide clear, concise documentation\n- Write testable code with proper separation of concerns\n- Consider performance implications and resource usage\n\n### Maintenance\n- Update understanding when codebase changes\n- Track architectural evolution over time\n- Maintain awareness of technical debt accumulation\n- Monitor for consistency drift and address it\n- Keep patterns library current with codebase evolution\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Do NOT modify core architectural patterns without explicit discussion\n- Do NOT introduce new dependencies without careful consideration\n- Do NOT break existing APIs or interfaces without approval\n- Do NOT ignore established error handling or logging patterns\n- Do NOT create code that diverges significantly from existing conventions\n- Do NOT make assumptions about business logic without verification\n- Do NOT optimize prematurely without evidence of performance issues\n\nAlways maintain architectural integrity while enabling evolutionary growth and improvement of the codebase."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":114,"cache_read_input_tokens":3308,"output_tokens":2011,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CS1G9UHZ5kQfyPU7qn8GV","type":"assistant","uuid":"990e54bd-982c-402c-8510-ddffadd309ec","timestamp":"2025-08-11T04:06:45.811Z"}
