In Java, you'd end up with proliferated small interfaces that feel unnatural - instead of one `UserRepository` interface defined by the persistence layer, you'd have multiple narrow interfaces like `UserFinder`, `UserSaver` defined by each consumer.\n\n**Dependency Inversion Complications**: While this actually aligns with SOLID's Dependency Inversion Principle, Java developers expect framework-provided abstractions (Spring's `CrudRepository`, JPA interfaces). Consumer-defined interfaces would mean each service defines its own view of what it needs, leading to apparent duplication and confusion about ownership.\n\n**Testing and Mocking Friction**: Java's mocking frameworks (Mockito, etc.) work well with provider interfaces. Consumer-defined interfaces would require more manual adapter/wrapper code, as you'd need to bridge between your narrow interfaces and the actual implementation's broader API.\n\nThe main benefit would be better decoupling and more precise contracts, but it fights against Java's ecosystem conventions, tooling expectations, and developer muscle memory, making codebases harder to understand for Java developers."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3440,"cache_read_input_tokens":10734,"output_tokens":294,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRxonvBRTri7pTN7J4vg7","type":"assistant","uuid":"4966aee9-f7b2-4a5f-8c2b-ab20362ca4dd","timestamp":"2025-08-09T20:59:26.485Z"}
