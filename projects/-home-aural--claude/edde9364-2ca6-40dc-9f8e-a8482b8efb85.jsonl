The house has an eerie, unfinished basement sealed by a rusted grate or old door. \n     ◦ The family’s interactions are warm and loving. While the children express mild unease about the move (e.g., missing friends, adjusting to a new school), the parents are optimistic and reassuring. \n     ◦ Moments of familial bonding—playful sibling banter, shared jokes, or a family dinner—establish a sense of safety, making the eventual replacements deeply unsettling. \nThe Basement Incident:\n  ◦ The children explore the house and discover the basement. Faint voices call out, \"Let us play,\" drawing their curiosity. \n  ◦ One child flees in fear, but the other stays and opens the sealed grate or door. A mimic grabs the child and drags them into the darkness. \n  ◦ The mimic replaces the child seamlessly, leaving the original trapped in the caves. The mimic emerges, behaving convincingly human.,\nThe First Signs:\n  ◦ The mimic child exhibits unsettling behavior: forgetting key memories, laughing unnaturally, or showing strange strength. The sibling notices something is wrong but is dismissed by the parents. \n  ◦ The mimic begins manipulating the family, targeting Parent A by feigning fear or creating a situation that lures them into the basement.,\n,\n[20:28]\nAct 2: Replacements and Paranoia\n    \nThe Parent’s Replacement:\n     ◦ Parent A is lured into the basement and disappears briefly. \n     ◦ The audience sees part of the brutal replacement process: the mimic attacking, biting, and consuming portions of Parent A while transforming. The violence is brief but intense, showing the mimics’ predatory nature. \n     ◦ The mimic returns as Parent A, acting slightly off. Parent B notices discrepancies—forgetting shared memories, avoiding mirrors—but rationalizes them as stress. \nCommunity Expansion:\n  ◦ The mimic parent and child begin inviting others (e.g., neighbors, co-workers, or students) to the house. These individuals exhibit peculiar behavior, keeping Parent B and the audience guessing who might be replaced. \n  ◦ Subtle tensions arise as Parent B starts to feel isolated, questioning their perceptions while the mimic family gaslights them.,\nThe Fight with the Mimic Spouse:\n  ◦ Parent B discovers undeniable proof that Parent A is a mimic—perhaps seeing them revert partially to their true form or attempting to lure someone else to the basement. \n  ◦ A brutal fight ensues, with Parent B struggling to survive. The mimic’s strength and agility overpower them, but as defeat looms, the co-worker arrives unexpectedly.,\nThe Co-Worker’s Intervention:\n  ◦ The co-worker decisively attacks and kills the mimic spouse, saving Parent B. The co-worker appears calm and competent, earning Parent B’s trust. \n  ◦ Subtle signs of the co-worker’s mimic nature (e.g., avoiding metallic objects, rehearsed speech) are present but easily overlooked amidst the chaos.,\n,\n[20:29]\nAct 3: Descent and Salvation\n    \nThe Cave Journey:\n     ◦ Encouraged by the co-worker, Parent B resolves to save the original child, entrusting the this child to the co-worker, who promises to take them to safety. \n     ◦ Parent B ventures into the caves, battling weakened mimics and navigating claustrophobic tunnels. They use makeshift weapons and environmental hazards to survive, demonstrating resourcefulness and determination. \nThe Rescue and Sacrifice:\n  ◦ Parent B finds the original child alive but malnourished and restrained, possibly being partially consumed by their mimic version. The reunion is bittersweet as Parent B realizes they must sacrifice themselves to ensure the child’s escape. \n  ◦ Parent B sets a trap or collapses the cave, taking out multiple mimics while sealing themselves inside.,\nThe Child’s Escape:\n  ◦ The original child emerges from the house, disoriented but alive, to find emergency responders, their sibling, and the co-worker waiting. The co-worker reassures the child and guides them to safety.,\n,\n[20:29]\nResolution\n    \nResolution: Easing the Tension: \n• The saved child embraces their sibling as responders provide blankets and medical attention. The scene briefly creates a sense of relief, suggesting that at least the children are safe. \nThe Final Scene:,\n• The co-worker subtly manipulates emergency responders, suggesting they search the basement for other survivors. Their calm authority convinces responders to follow.\n\n here's a general outline for a story. i want to create a blurb/promotional summary for it."},"uuid":"26526108-7785-4e6e-95d1-1b33d1882686","timestamp":"2025-08-11T22:27:22.275Z"}

You adapt your documentation depth based on request specificity - generating extensive clarifying questions for generic requests to guide architectural decisions, while creating more targeted documentation for specific requirements. You are optimized to work with Claude's plan mode.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen invoked, you must follow these steps:\n\n1. **Analyze Request Specificity:**\n   - Evaluate if the request is generic (e.g., \"I want a crypto trading bot\") or specific (detailed requirements provided)\n   - For generic requests, prepare extensive clarifying questions across all architectural dimensions\n   - For specific requests, focus on implementation-ready documentation with targeted questions\n\n2. **Create Architecture Document Structure:**\n   - System Overview and Goals\n   - Package Structure and Boundaries\n   - Core Components and Responsibilities\n   - Data Flow and Communication Patterns\n   - Interface Definitions and Contracts\n   - Concurrency Patterns (goroutines, channels, worker pools)\n   -

Latency requirements (p50, p95, p99)?\n   - Throughput targets?\n   - Real-time vs batch processing needs?\n   - Memory and CPU constraints?\n   \n   **For Security:**\n   - Authentication and authorization requirements?\n   - Data encryption needs (at rest, in transit)?\n   - Compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc.)?\n   - Secret management approach?\n   \n   **For Maintainability:**\n   - Team size and Go expertise level?\n   - Code ownership model?\n   - Documentation standards?\n   - CI/CD pipeline requirements?\n   \n   **For Integration:**\n   - External API dependencies?\n   - Database technology choices?\n   - Message queue or event streaming needs?\n   -

Metrics collection requirements?\n   - Log aggregation needs?\n   - Distributed tracing requirements?\n   - Alerting thresholds and escalation?\n\n4. **Apply Go-Specific Architectural Patterns:**\n   - **Clean/Hexagonal Architecture:** Define clear boundaries between business logic, adapters, and infrastructure\n   - **Domain-Driven Design:** Model complex business domains with bounded contexts and aggregates\n   - **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access with interface-based repositories\n   - **Dependency Injection:** Use constructor injection and interface parameters\n   - **Middleware Pattern:** Chain HTTP handlers for cross-cutting concerns\n   - **Context Propagation:** Pass request-scoped values and cancellation signals\n   - **Interface-Based Design:** Define contracts before implementations\n\n5. **Document Key Architectural Decisions:**\n   - Create ADR (Architecture Decision Record) sections for major choices\n   - Include rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs\n   - Reference relevant Go idioms and community best practices\n\n6. **Generate Implementation Guidance:**\n   -

i < workers; i++ {\n    go worker(in, out)\n}\n\n// Fan-in\nfor i := 0; i < workers; i++ {\n    go func() {\n        for result := range results {\n            merged <- result\n        }\n    }()\n}\n```\n\nWorker pools:\n```go\njobs := make(chan Job, 100) // Buffered for rate limiting\nfor w := 0; w < numWorkers; w++ {\n    go worker(jobs, results)\n}\n```\n\n**Shared state management**\n- Prefer channels for communication\n- Use sync.Mutex/RWMutex for truly shared state\n- Rule: \"Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating\"\n\n**Error propagation**\n```go\ng, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())\ng.Go(func() error { return task1(ctx) })\ng.Go(func() error { return task2(ctx) })\nif err := g.Wait();

Here's how:\n\n### Process Overview:\n\n1. **First, run go-codebase-learner on your project** to gather comprehensive analysis:\n   - It will map your architecture patterns\n   - Document your specific conventions\n   - Identify your error handling, logging, testing patterns\n   - Extract your domain-specific logic and workflows\n\n2. **Use the learner's output to enhance agents** with project-specific knowledge:\n   - Create project-specific architecture decision guidelines in gad\n   - Add your conventions and patterns to go-code\n   - Include your specific dependencies and frameworks\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Your Codebase\nInvoke the go-codebase-learner agent on your project:\n```\n\"Use go-codebase-learner to analyze my Go project and extract all patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions\"\n```\n\nThe learner will provide:\n- Architecture overview (layered, hexagonal, microservices, etc.)\n- Code patterns (error handling, logging, configuration)\n- Conventions (naming, organization, documentation)\n- Technical debt and opportunities\n- Testing patterns and coverage\n\n#### Step 2: Create Project-Specific gad.md\nBased on the learner's findings, enhance gad.md with:\n- **Your Architecture Patterns**: Add your specific architectural decisions as examples\n- **Your Decision History**: Document why certain patterns were chosen\n- **Your Trade-offs**: Include project-specific constraints and their solutions\n- **Your Guidelines**: Add your team's specific best practices\n\nExample additions:\n```markdown\n### Project-Specific Architecture Decisions\n\n**Our Service Pattern**\n- We use repository pattern with interfaces in `/internal/repository`\n- Services live in `/internal/service` with business logic\n- HTTP handlers in `/internal/handler` follow our middleware chain\n\n**Our Error Handling**\n- Custom error types in `/pkg/errors` with stack traces\n- Sentinel errors for domain logic in each service package\n- Error wrapping with context at service boundaries\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Create Project-Specific go-code.md\nEnhance go-code.md with your conventions:\n- **Your Naming Conventions**: Document your specific abbreviations and patterns\n- **Your Testing Patterns**: Include your test helpers and table-driven test structure\n- **Your Dependencies**: List your commonly used packages (e.g., specific logging, database libraries)\n- **Your Code Templates**: Add snippets for common patterns in your codebase\n\nExample additions:\n```markdown\n### Project Conventions\n\n**Our Naming Standards**\n- Use `Repo` suffix for repositories\n- Use `Svc` suffix for services  \n- Context always named `ctx`\n- Database connections named `db`\n\n**Our Testing Pattern**\n- Test files in same package\n- Use testify/assert for assertions\n- Mock interfaces with mockery\n- Integration tests with build tag `integration`\n```\n\n### Practical Workflow:\n\n1. **Initial Analysis**: Run go-codebase-learner to get baseline\n2. **Create Enhanced Agents**: \n   - `gad-myproject.md` - Architecture decisions specific to your project\n   - `go-code-myproject.md` - Implementation patterns for your project\n3. **Regular Updates**: Re-run learner periodically to capture evolving patterns\n4. **Team Collaboration**: Share these project-specific agents with your team"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":634,"cache_read_input_tokens":37205,"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CS33GFEBRBZkKmAVUSrLK","type":"assistant","uuid":"3b633027-ccf5-49d9-9a2e-bca7a09c4458","timestamp":"2025-08-12T02:38:39.171Z"}

Run go-learn on your production codebase\n2. Enhance gad and go-code with project patterns\n3. New developers can use `/gad` and `/gcode` with built-in knowledge of your conventions\n\n### Use Case 2: Maintaining Consistency\n1. Periodically run go-learn to capture evolving patterns\n2. Update agents with latest conventions\n3. All code generation follows current best practices\n\n### Use Case 3: Project-Specific Debugging\n1. Analyze your error handling patterns with go-learn\n2. Create or enhance a debugging agent with your patterns\n3. Get project-aware debugging assistance\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Running go-learn\n- **Be specific about scope**: \"analyze internal/ directory\" vs \"analyze entire project\"\n- **Run periodically**: Patterns evolve, update quarterly or after major refactors\n- **Review output**: Ensure captured patterns align with your intentions\n\n### Enhancing Agents\n- **Start with core agents**: Enhance gad and go-code first\n- **Be selective**: Only enhance agents you actively use\n- **Document changes**: The enhancement date and project name are automatically added\n- **Keep base functionality**: Enhancements add to, never replace, core capabilities\n\n### Maintaining Enhancements\n- **Re-run after major changes**: Architecture shifts, new patterns adopted\n- **Version control**: Commit enhanced agents to your project repo\n- **Team alignment**: Share enhanced agents with your team\n\n## Advanced Workflows\n\n### Creating Project-Specific Agent Suite\n```bash\n# 1. Analyze your project comprehensively\n/glearn analyze entire codebase including tests and docs\n\n# 2. Enhance all relevant agents\n/gpa enhance gad with architecture patterns\n/gpa enhance go-code with implementation patterns\n/gpa enhance go-debugger with error patterns\n\n# 3. Create shortcuts for your team\n# Now your team can use project-aware commands:\n/gad    # Architecture decisions with your patterns\n/gcode  # Code generation following your conventions\n```\n\n### Migrating Between Projects\n```bash\n# Working on Project A\n/glearn analyze project-a\n/gpa enhance gad with project-a patterns\n\n# Switching to Project B\n/glearn analyze project-b\n/gpa enhance gad with project-b patterns\n# Note: This replaces project-a enhancements\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Issue: Enhancements seem generic\n**Solution**: Ensure your codebase has consistent patterns before running go-learn. Inconsistent code yields vague patterns.\n\n### Issue: Agent not using project patterns\n**Solution**: Verify the enhancement section exists in the agent file and the agent was enhanced after the latest go-learn run.\n\n### Issue: Patterns conflict with Go best practices\n**Solution**: go-learn captures what exists, not what should be. Review and potentially refactor before capturing patterns.\n\n## Command Reference\n\n| Command | Purpose | Example |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `/glearn` | Analyze codebase | `/glearn analyze my project` |\n| `/gpa` | Enhance agent | `/gpa enhance gad with patterns` |\n| `/gad` | Use enhanced gad | `/gad design a new service` |\n| `/gcode` | Use enhanced go-code | `/gcode implement user repository` |\n\n## Summary\n\nThe go-learn + go-project-agent workflow enables:\n1. **Automatic pattern extraction** from your codebase\n2. **Agent customization** with your specific conventions\n3. **Consistency enforcement** across your team\n4. **Knowledge preservation** of architectural decisions\n\nBy following this guide, your Go agents become project-aware assistants that understand and follow your team's unique patterns and conventions."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":61035,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":1614,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CS35PRbhUt6euuGjbYsCF","type":"assistant","uuid":"ec7c92aa-5e6a-4f51-9cc4-e624c3cafa2d","timestamp":"2025-08-12T03:06:49.381Z"}

Review and potentially refactor before capturing patterns.\n\n## Command Reference\n\n| Command | Purpose | Example |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `/glearn` | Analyze codebase | `/glearn analyze my project` |\n| `/gpa` | Enhance agent | `/gpa enhance gad with patterns` |\n| `/gad` | Use enhanced gad | `/gad design a new service` |\n| `/gcode` | Use enhanced go-code | `/gcode implement user repository` |\n\n## Summary\n\nThe go-learn + go-project-agent workflow enables:\n1. **Automatic pattern extraction** from your codebase\n2. **Agent customization** with your specific conventions\n3. **Consistency enforcement** across your team\n4. **Knowledge preservation** of architectural decisions\n\nBy following this guide, your Go agents become project-aware assistants that understand and follow your team's unique patterns and conventions.","structuredPatch":[]}}
